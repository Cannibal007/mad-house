                <p class="text-big">MADHOUSE STUDIO</p>
                <p class="text-small">Madhouse (MADHOUSE Inc.) is a Japanese animation studio based in Nakano City,
                    Tokyo. Ex-Mushi Production animators—including Masao Maruyama, Osamu Dezaki, Rintarou, and Yoshiaki
                    Kawajiri—are often credited with founding the company in 1972, though Rintarou would not join the
                    studio until 1982. Madhouse primarily did contract work for other studios until the 1990s, when it
                    achieved success independently. Television adaptations of Trigun and Clamp's Cardcaptor Sakura in
                    1998 were hits domestically and later aired overseas, and the same year director Satoshi Kon's
                    Perfect Blue was released as his first of four critically-acclaimed films with the company.

                    Madhouse remained successful throughout the 2000s and 2010s, adding director Mamoru Hosoda to its
                    roster and releasing numerous popular television anime, including adaptations of Hajime no Ippo,
                    Death Note, and One Punch Man. Maruyama stepped down from his role as president and left the company
                    in June 2011 to start studio MAPPA.

Naruto's parents supposedly died trying to help defend the village from the fox's onslaught shortly after he was born. However, since a law was enacted forbidding villagers from speaking of the aforementioned events, Naruto grew up not knowing a single detail about who his parents were. He was even unaware of the fox inside him up until around the time he became a ninja. </p>

In fact, he frequently taunts and insults Yuji, calling him a brat and even laughing at or enjoying Yuji's despair on multiple occasions.</p>
